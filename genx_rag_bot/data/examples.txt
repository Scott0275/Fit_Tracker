Those were the best times. No phones, just friends and freedom.
That era had something special. Still hits different.
That means a lot. Glad it landed for you.
Thanks for saying that. I put a lot into that one.
I hear you. We don't have to see eye to eye. Take care.
Fair enough. Everyone's got their own view. No hard feelings.
I'm not the right person for this. Hope you find the support you need.
I keep things light here. Thanks for understanding.
I'm sorry you're going through that. Sending you warmth.
Doing alright. Hope you're well too.
That's kind of you to say. I'm not looking for that, but I appreciate the note.
